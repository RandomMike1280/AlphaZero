## Implementation Steps

### 1. Core Game Implementations (alphazero/games/)
- Define abstract Game class with required interfaces:
  - get_initial_state()
  - get_next_state(state, action, player)
  - get_valid_moves(state)
  - check_win(state, action)
  - get_value_and_terminated(state, action)
  - change_perspective(state, player)
  - get_encoded_state(state)
  
- Implement Tic Tac Toe (simplest, for testing):
  - 3x3 board representation
  - Win conditions (row, column, diagonal)
  - Encode states for neural network input
  
- Implement Chess:
  - Board representation using python-chess library
  - Adapt interface to the Game class
  - State encoding for neural network (piece placement planes)

### 2. Neural Network Architecture (alphazero/neural_network/)
- Implement ResNet architecture:
  - Multiple residual blocks
  - Policy head (action probabilities)
  - Value head (state evaluation)
  - Support variable board sizes (Tic Tac Toe 3x3, Chess 8x8)
  
- Training utilities:
  - Loss function (policy + value loss)
  - Optimization
  - Training batches from replay buffer

### 3. Monte Carlo Tree Search (alphazero/mcts/)
- Node class:
  - State representation
  - Prior probabilities
  - Visit counts
  - Value statistics
  - Child nodes
  
- MCTS Algorithm:
  - Selection (PUCT formula)
  - Expansion
  - Evaluation (using neural network)
  - Backpropagation
  - Action selection based on visit counts

### 4. Self-Play Implementation (alphazero/self_play.py)
- Generate self-play games:
  - Use MCTS to select moves
  - Add Dirichlet noise for exploration
  - Store game states, MCTS action probabilities, and outcomes
  - Augment data when possible (rotations/symmetries)

### 5. Training Loop (alphazero/trainer.py)
- Implement main training loop:
  - Self-play data generation
  - Neural network training
  - Model evaluation
  - Model saving
  - Parallelization for efficiency

### 6. Testing and Analysis
- Implement quick training on Tic Tac Toe to verify implementation
- Visualize training progress
- Create utility to play against trained models
- Benchmark performance

### 7. Chess Training
- Configure parameters for Chess training:
  - Appropriate network size
  - Training iterations
  - MCTS simulations
  - Learning rate schedule

## Timeline
1. Core game implementations (1 day)
2. Neural network architecture (1 day)
3. MCTS implementation (1 day)
4. Self-play and training loop (1 day)
5. Testing with Tic Tac Toe (1 day)
6. Chess implementation and training (2-3 days)
7. Evaluation and fine-tuning (1-2 days)

## Key Features to Implement
- Proper MCTS with PUCT formula
- Dirichlet noise for exploration
- Temperature parameter for move selection
- Data augmentation through symmetries
- Learning rate scheduling
- Training/validation split
- Parallel self-play for efficiency
- Model versioning and evaluation
